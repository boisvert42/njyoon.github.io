## Crossword PDF Editor

Currently testing out two new features: 
- Add Image (under Header Content)
- Remember Options (under Basic Options)

All saved options are stored locally (i.e., nothing is ever uploaded to the servers), and can be cleared by clicking the Clear Cache button underneath Remember Options.

## NYT Submission Editor

This tool adds some additional editing options to Crossword Nexus's [PUZ to NYT Converter](https://crosswordnexus.com/apps/puz-to-pdf/). The submission format is based on the [New York Times's construction guidelines](https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/submissions/crossword). To get started, select a .puz file, add your header content, and click "Preview PDF".
