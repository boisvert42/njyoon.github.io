## Crossword PDF Editor

Currently testing out two new features: 
- Add Image (under Header Content)
- Remember Options (under Basic Options)

All options are stored locally (i.e., nothing is ever uploaded to the servers), and can be cleared by clicking the Clear Cache button underneath Remember Options.
